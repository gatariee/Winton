<i>Yet another Command and Control (C2) framework written in Golang</i>
</div>

Winton is an open-source cross-platform C2 framework written for the purposes of learning adversary emulation and C2 infrastructure.

> üêí Winton was designed solely for educational purposes, it is still nowhere close to being operationally functional for red team engagements!

[17/2/2024] No longer maintained, will be rehauling the project to address massive implementation flaws and overall better code quality. 

Feel free to use the code in this repository as a starting point for writing your own stage zero C2.
